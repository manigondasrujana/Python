       "  <sentence id=\"s3\">Wilcox J made orders ancillary to the Mareva orders on 22 March 2005 requiring each of the Sharman applicants to disclose on affidavit the description and value of all of their assets, wherever situated, and to specify whether those assets were held by each applicant either beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s4\">2 Wilcox J delivered judgment on the complex issues of liability arising in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2005 ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s5\">In the meantime, Ms Hemming had filed two disclosure affidavits pursuant to Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 whilst Sharman License and Sharman Networks had unsuccessfully sought several stays on various grounds of that same order insofar as it applied to them (see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 406 per Hely J, delivered 8 April 2005; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 441 per Wilcox J, delivered 15 April 2005 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 per Moore J, delivered 28 April 2005).</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s19\">The Music companies' case presented to Moore J below was that there was in fact no such antecedent loan, that the transfer of such funds by Ms Henning to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham loan repayment, and that such funds have therefore continued to be her own moneys on the footing presumably of a constructive trust, and should have been identified as such in her affidavit of disclosure of her assets made pursuant to the Mareva orders.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s20\">Although Moore J declined to make a finding in relation to the issue as to ownership of that fund, his Honour formed the view that he would permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on matters concerning the fund, by reason of doubts attending the same.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s21\">His Honour reasoned in that regard at [37] of his reasons for judgment as follows:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   'In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the monies transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by [Ms Hemming].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s22\">Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming].</sentence>,\n",

       "   Legal principles informing the grant of leave to appeal \n",
       "   \n",
       "  6 Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) stipulates that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single judge, being a judgment that is interlocutory in nature, unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s24\">Although s 24(1A) does not purport to qualify or limit the Court's discretion (see Dcor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 in the joint reasons for judgment of Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ), the Courts have developed general principles which inform the exercise of the discretion to refuse or grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s25\">The rationale for those principles is the public interest in the efficient administration of justice, and the maintenance of 'the integrity and vigour of the procedures of the court, including as they do, the immediate involvement of the judge at all stages in the progress of cases to trial' ( Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corp Australia Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 165 at 173, per Gummow J).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s26\">One consequence sought to be avoided is the expansion of expensive and delaying pre-trial litigation involved in appeals on issues of practice and procedure, and the concomitant reduction in the authority of the trial judge, should such appeals be frequently entertained ( Bomanite at 176, per French J).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s27\">7 At least for those reasons, this Court has held on a number of occasions that typically a party seeking leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment ought to establish, first, that in all the circumstances, the decision from which leave is sought to appeal is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the same being reconsidered by the Full Court, and secondly, that substantial injustice would result if such leave was to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong: see Dcor at 398.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s28\">That those two questions were the touchstone of exercise of discretion in matters of this kind was common ground between the parties.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s29\">I observe that it is well accepted that those criteria are not to be applied rigidly or fixedly, and the Court must bear in mind all of the circumstances of the particular case: see in that regard Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, where Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s36\">Those obligations were said to be no different in principle to any other interlocutory procedural order of the court, whether made pre-trial or during a trial, requiring parties to swear affidavits, to answer questions in cross-examination and to provide documentation.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s37\">On the question of what constitutes 'substantial injustice' for the purposes of determining an application for leave to appeal, counsel for the Music companies placed particular reliance upon the decision of the Full Federal Court delivered earlier in the primary proceedings, which denied leave to appeal from a decision by Wilcox J refusing to set aside Anton Piller orders that his Honour had earlier made: Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 373.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s40\">They maintained that the requirement to appear for cross-examination was not analogous to the 'routine steps' of swearing an affidavit during the normal course of a trial and entering the witness box to answer questions related to its contents.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s42\">I was referred by the Sharman applicants to an earlier Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 in support of their submission that since the present circumstances give rise to an important question of principle, leave to appeal should be readily granted.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s49\">The Music companies' position was that the orders requiring Ms Hemming to file an affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks, and to attend for cross-examination on the affidavit she had earlier sworn as to disclosure of her assets, were merely procedural in nature and therefore, incapable as such of determining any final rights of the parties.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s52\">The Music companies rejected any notion to the effect that the mere fact of Ms Hemming being compelled to swear an affidavit as to disclosure of Sharman Networks' assets, and to attend for cross-examination upon her own disclosure affidavits, without more, amounted to 'substantial injustice', in the sense that such expression has been used in numerous authorities concerned with the grant of leave to appeal.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s54\">The reality of the dilemma in which the Court is placed by the present application is the need for consideration in some depth of the matters to which attention has been drawn by the Sharman applicants, before determining whether leave to appeal ought formally to be granted to appeal in the first place.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s57\">The following passages appearing at [7]-[8] and [13]-[14] of their Honour's reasons for judgment in Brilliant Digital were asserted by the Music companies to be apposite to the present application: \n",

       "   '[7] In our view these matters [the matters contended by the applicants to amount to substantial injustice] would not, either individually or cumulatively, occasion injustice to the applicants of such a character and to such a degree as to justify the grant of leave.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s59\">The flexibility of the principles governing the grant of leave to appeal indicates that the concept of substantial injustice must also be flexible.</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",
       "   [8] The distinction between interlocutory decisions concerning matters of practice and procedure and those that concern the substantive interests of the parties recognises both the greater likelihood of an incorrect decision as to a substantive right causing substantial injustice and the importance of preserving a judge's power to supervise the orderly preparation of a matter for trial.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s76\">They pointed out that Moore J had reached his decision to impose those orders after careful application of the relevant legal principles, with due consideration of the lengthy evidence put before him by both parties.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s77\">Moreover, Moore J was said to have made it clear in [39] of his reasons for judgment that any cross-examination would be subject to the control of the Court, thereby limiting any prejudice that may be suffered by Ms Hemming or the other applicants.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s78\">In those circumstances, counsel for the Music companies further contended that the applicants had failed to show that the obligations imposed upon them by Moore J amounted to anything greater than 'mere inconvenience'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s79\">On that footing, the Music companies concluded that the Sharman applicants had failed to overcome the threshold requirement of establishing substantial injustice, and that leave to appeal should be refused on that basis alone.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s80\">Acceptance of that proposition was said to have the consequence realistically that consideration of the draft grounds of appeal from Moore J's judgment as formulated by the Sharman applicants, would not be necessary.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s81\">There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s82\">15 The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance, the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed, but in the present case, Ms Hemming was yet to be cross-examined and had not, as at the date of hearing of the application, sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s83\">I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal, the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore J's order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit, and that I refused to grant that stay, but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s84\">Because a Full Court on appeal is in a position to intervene in relation to the subjection of Ms Hemming to Moore J's orders, and because those orders were made, on the Sharman applicants' case, erroneously by his Honour, it was contended by the Sharman applicants to be unjust if leave to appeal was not to be granted in relation to his Honour's orders.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s85\">16 The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court 'regularly' grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried, and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle, citing as authority Wong at [22].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s86\">In Wong , the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s87\">No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish 'substantial injustice' before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s88\">Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance, since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a 'mere allegation'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s89\">So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox, Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemming's control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s90\">In any event the Music companies submitted that the Court's decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital , which required inter alia that 'substantial injustice' be shown.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s91\">There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s92\">17 Contrary moreover to the Music companies' primary submissions, the Sharman applicants contended that should leave to appeal be refused, they would indeed suffer 'substantial injustice'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s93\">That was said to be because the order to cross-examine a deponent of a disclosure affidavit was an exceptional one, and because Moore J had failed correctly to apply the relevant principles in making the order, in that his Honour had not made a positive finding that the affidavit disclosure by Ms Hemming of her own assets was inadequate.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s94\">In my opinion however, the reasons of the primary judgment, which I have extracted in [5] above of these reasons are in substance to that effect, or at least sufficiently so.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s95\">In any event, the making of an order requiring cross-examination on a disclosure affidavit was said by the Sharman applicants to be tantamount to a finding of contempt, or at least predicated upon such a finding.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s96\">That latter contention would seem to be directed to an overstatement, in circumstances where the complaint was inadequate responses to the enforcement of orders made ancillary to Mareva relief.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s132\">24 All that was referrable of course to the implications of the payment of $1,116,405.63 by Ms Hemming to TIL, following the sale of her Sydney residence on 4 February 2005; that payment appears to have been made out of the proceeds of a sale of that residence, which was effected for the gross price of $2,100,000 to a person identified by the evidence as an accountant of certain of the Sharman companies.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s135\">The Sharman applicants postulated that the 'remark' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour's reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that '[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a \"client services agreement\" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002' was an 'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s136\">That submission lacked merit, particularly in the light of [31] of Lindgren J's reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the two-fold acceptance, given in cross-examination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J, that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks, and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement, Ms Hemming 'controlled the Sharman trust'.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s160\">Those issues were to have been debated before his Honour at length below 'but were never resolved'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s161\">Certainly the premise upon which the order is sought, as I have already sought to explain, was an inadequacy of disclosure of such matters in circumstances that indicated the need for further exploration and inquiry.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s162\">29 It was next asserted by the Sharman applicants that the high point of his Honour's conclusion below, both as to the so-called 'putative ownership by Ms Hemming of the Sharman Trust' and as to 'the existence or otherwise of the loan made by TIL to Ms Hemming repaid in February 2005', was that there was 'a lack of clarity' about the matter.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s163\">My observation is however, that any such lack of clarity about the alleged loan and its repayment or partial repayment derives from its inherently commercially, inexplicable origins and purposes in the first place.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s164\">It was submitted therefore to be an unprincipled exercise of discretion for his Honour to have ordered cross-examination in circumstances where the Music companies had not convinced his Honour upon either of those conditions which they had raised.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s165\">In truth, so the submissions continued, his Honour fell into the error of making an order for cross-examination in circumstances where no basis had been demonstrated to the Court to make such an order.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s167\">30 In conclusion therefore, it was the case of the Sharman applicants that Moore J failed correctly to apply the relevant legal principles in committing Ms Hemming to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavit, and that it must follow that the Sharman applicants would inherently suffer 'substantial injustice' if Ms Hemming be so required to submit to cross-examination in accordance with the relief granted by the primary judge.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s168\">In short, the complaint was that Moore J gave leave for the cross-examination to take place because the Court might 'be left with a greater measure of certainty' [36], and further 'because cross-examination may lead to greater clarity' [37], and that so much exemplified errors in principle in the exercise of his discretion.</sentence>,\n",

       "  31 In my opinion, and for the reasons I have largely foreshadowed in my observations upon the submissions already recorded, the application for leave to appeal brought by the Sharman applicants has not sufficient cogency to justify the grant of any such leave.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s170\">The case of the Music companies presented to the primary judge (Moore J) for relief of the nature and to the extent granted was sufficiently in line with established principle as to be clear from 'sufficient doubt'.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s172\">His Honour's approach in particular to the issue of granting leave to the Music companies to cross-examine Ms Hemming was soundly justified in the light of the evidentiary circumstances concerning the Sharman applicants' offshore trust structure, and the circumstances of and context in which such a substantial sum of money was transferred to an offshore company in the amount and in the context that occurred.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s173\">32 It is readily apparent that the primary judge placed significant weight, and I think rightly so, upon the following findings made by Lindgren J in the context of the preceding interlocutory proceedings of Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 , being proceedings which I have referred to earlier.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s175\">Since TIL, as trustee of the Sharman Trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the Sharman Companies, there was evidence before his Honour to show that they were also likely to act at her direction.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s45\">In addition, the Court should have regard to the protection of the 'structure and integrity of the appellate process' (see Iyer at [23]), to which it is relevant, though not determinative, that the appellant failed to comply with Court deadlines for providing reasons why the grounds were not raised below, and particulars of the arguments relied upon.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s46\">9 The appellant argued that her request for leave is supported by these factors: the facts are not in dispute and there is no possible need to admit new evidence for the new grounds (as in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1) (' Coulton '); granting leave would not be an effective grant of a new trial (also as in Coulton ); and the new grounds raised were involved as parts of the appellant's claim before the Tribunal.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s101\">In the Tribunal's view, the essential and significant reason for the harm feared by the [appellant] is personal, namely revenge or retaliation for her father's complaint to the police and not any Convention related reason.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s102\">The Tribunal finds that the harm feared by the [appellant] is not Convention related [sic].</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  16 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal's reasoning demonstrates that it failed to understand both the nature of this part of her claim and the evidence relating to it.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s104\">Whilst the Tribunal had said there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia are singled out for sexual assault, it did accept there was a 'general vulnerability felt by the ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s105\">In light of this acceptance, the Tribunal was obliged to deal with the appellant's claim that ethnic Chinese are likely to be targets of violence, and the evidence in support of that claim.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s106\">There was evidence that, although government administrations have been more benevolent towards ethnic Chinese since 1998, ethnic Chinese, and Christians, have been targets of violence since that time.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s107\">The appellant submitted that the Tribunal jurisdictionally erred by not making findings on that evidence (which included a suggestion that Chinese women frequently wore chastity belts, such was their fear of rape), and thereby not considering it relevant in reaching its conclusion on this part of her claim.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s108\">17 In concluding that there was no evidence to support a finding that ethnic Chinese women were singled out for sexual assault, the Tribunal referred to evidence submitted by the appellant that according to a non-government organisation 'sexual violence, including rape, mostly against women and children, could take place anywhere and involve anyone regardless of walk of life, education or age'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s109\">The appellant submitted that this did not undermine her claim: evidence that many women in Indonesia are at risk of rape does not deny that ethnic Chinese women may possess a well-founded fear of rape on grounds of their being ethnic Chinese.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s110\">18 In response, the Minister argued two things.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s111\">First, that the Court should not read literally the Tribunal's use of the phrase 'no evidence': reading the Tribunal's reasons reasonably beneficially, it is clear enough that the Tribunal meant that there was no evidence it found convincing.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s112\">Second, and perhaps more importantly, that the validity of the intended ground of the appellant's appeal is immaterial, given that the Tribunal concluded that the essential and significant reason for the future harm feared by the appellant was not related to a Convention reason but was personal: she fears that she will be harmed again by her attacker in revenge for her father's complaint to the police.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s113\">19 In my opinion, given the Tribunal's factual findings the Minister's submissions must be upheld.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s114\">In the first place, the Tribunal's finding as to the true nature of the appellant's fear was a free-standing and sufficient reason to reject her claim to refugee status.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s115\">(There is a qualification to this as to the claim that, at street level, no adequate State protection via the police is available to the appellant, the lack being attributable to Convention reasons, but this is dealt with below).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s116\">On that finding, the persecution she feared was not for a Convention reason --- the Tribunal member rejected the hypothesis that the appellant was attacked because she was Chinese.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s117\">It follows that she could not have been attacked because she was a member of the social group, ethnic Chinese women, found by the Tribunal to exist.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s118\">20 Secondly, read as a whole, and beneficially, the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently indicate that by 'no evidence' the Tribunal meant 'no sufficient reason'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s119\">Such an assessment was legally within the Tribunal's province.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s120\">21 Thirdly, it is now trite that the Tribunal was only required to refer to the evidence it found persuasive and not to explain its rejection of each other piece of evidence.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s125\">The Tribunal found that Indonesian women participate in education, the work force and politics.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s126\">Based on a 'country report' from the State Department of the United States of America, the Tribunal stated that whilst the Indonesian Guidelines of State Policy and legal statutes adopted by the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) state that women's participation in the development process must not conflict with their role in improving family welfare and the education of the younger generation, the Guidelines explicitly state that women have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s138\">The appellant submitted that the written reasons of the Tribunal demonstrate that in considering the third matter identified in the quote from Applicant S above (ie whether the social group was distinguishable from the rest of society), the Tribunal actually tested whether women in Indonesia were cohesive or 'share interests, goals or aspirations'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s139\">The appellant pointed out that cohesiveness is not a necessary element of a particular social group; thus the Tribunal misunderstood the test to be applied.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s140\">The Minister argued that the Tribunal's written reasons on 'a particular social group' demonstrate that the Tribunal gave significance to the integration of women into civil society and the conferral on them of the same rights and obligations as men, and not the cohesiveness or otherwise of Indonesian women as a social group.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s141\">26 A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole does not leave me with the impression that the Tribunal, under cover of silence, applied a test of whether women in Indonesian were cohesive or shared interests, goals or aspirations.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s160\">In oral submissions, the appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal applied the correct test, it would have been open to it to conclude that the failure by the authorities to protect the appellant was for a Convention reason: the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 (' Khawar ') is authority for the proposition that criminal activity committed by a private individual, which is tolerated or condoned by the State because it systematically discriminates on Convention grounds, may amount to persecution.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s161\">31 In considering whether effective state protection was available, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal was required to consider whether there was a reasonably effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice: see S152 at [26].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s162\">The appellant argued that the Tribunal's reasoning reveals no consideration of whether effective state protection was available to the appellant 'on the ground' or at a 'micro' level, as was required: the question was, what would be available as a practical matter to a woman in the position of the appellant?</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s163\">32 The appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal really questioned whether there was an effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice, as required by S152 , it would have dealt with the suggestion by the appellant's father that the police had not responded to his complaint of his daughter's rape because she is Chinese, and that the appellant was raped again after the complaint.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s164\">33 The Minister conceded that the evidence dealt with by the Tribunal on the issue of state protection consisted of 'broad' considerations of what the state was attempting to do to remedy the problems of rape in Indonesia.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s169\">34 The Minister further argued that in a case of persecution by non-state agents the question of state protection may be relevant at three stages of the inquiry: whether the fear is well-founded; whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution, and; whether the appellant is unable, or, owing to fear of persecution, unwilling, to avail herself of the protection of her state: S152 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [21].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s170\">It was for this reason that the High Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in S152 that turned on a finding, similar to the appellant's argument in this appeal, that the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether there was protection available 'in a practical sense'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s171\">35 However, while the 'ability of the state to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens', may , as counsel for the Minister submitted, be relevant at three stages of the inquiry, it is here, in my view, relevant to the second question identified by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, viz 'whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution' (at [21]).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s172\">If the state, despite the good intentions of its leaders, is not able, at what might be called the operational or grass-roots level, to have its operatives provide an acceptable level of protection against serious harm, and the dereliction of those operatives has as its basis their discrimination of a Convention kind against the appellant, that situation, as Hale LJ put it in Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] 1 NLR 15, 'may turn the acts of others [ie non-state actors] into persecution for a Convention reason' (at 52 and quoted with approval by Lord Hope of Craighead in the appeal to the House of Lords (see [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 at 497)).</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s287\">To observe that she had suffered an 'ordeal', yet appeared capable in Australia, where the social environment is entirely different and she has family support, is simply not to acknowledge the major difficulty in the 'practical realities', both psychological and physical, that now would confront her if returned to Indonesia.</sentence>,\n",

       "  1 This is an application for the issue of the constitutional writs of certiorari and prohibition together with an injunction, pursuant to section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and section 475A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (\"the Act \") concerning a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (\"R R T\") made on 9 June 2004 affirming a decision of the delegate of the Respondent not to grant the Applicant a Protection (Class XA) Visa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s1\">Consistent with the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, I propose to make an order joining the R R T as the Second Respondent in the proceedings although for the purposes of these Reasons I will describe the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as the Respondent.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s2\">2 The essential contention in this application is that the R R T fell into jurisdictional error by failing to conduct a review of the Respondent's decision and therefore failed to exercise the statutory jurisdiction since the Tribunal failed to properly consider whether the Applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations pursuant to section 36(2) of the Act as a refugee consistent with Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , 189 UNTS 150 and the 1967 New York Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 606 UNTS 267 (and thus a person entitled to a protection visa pursuant to section 65 of the Act ).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s3\">The failure to properly consider whether the Applicant is such a person is said to arise because the Tribunal failed to consider all elements of the Convention definition of \"refugee\" for the purposes of the Act , applied an adverse finding on credibility to a determination of all relevant factual questions, improperly relied upon apparent inconsistencies between the evidence of the Applicant and a Mr (Pastor) George Ddungu, failed to provide the Applicant with adequate particulars of the evidence of Mr Ddungu the Tribunal considered would form part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Delegate of the Respondent, failed to properly consider evidence establishing a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason (assuming findings on the question of credibility properly excluded particular evidence) and failed to have regard to relevant evidence which would have been decisive in the determination of the application in the Applicant's favour.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s4\">3 The findings of the R R T on the question of the credibility of the Applicant and whether reliance could be placed upon any evidence of the Applicant, was a central matter to the claim that the R R T had failed to properly exercise the statutory jurisdiction of review.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s5\">The Background Facts \n",
       "   \n",
       "  4 The background facts put to the R R T in a statutory declaration from the Applicant dated 1 July 2003 in support of the review, are these.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s8\">Prior to departing Uganda for Australia in October 2002, the Applicant was the Assistant Pastor to the Christ Alive Church in Uganda and the full time coordinator of a project called Earthlife Uganda and a further project called the Progressive Farmers Club (a project designed to assist the poor to become involved in various income generating activities).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s9\">6 The Applicant's father was killed when the Applicant was quite young.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s10\">The Applicant's father had become involved in the activities of the Democratic Party opposed to the Government of President Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress Party.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s12\">Some years ago (approximately early 2000) a referendum occurred in Uganda to determine whether Uganda should adopt a party system called the \"Movement System\" proposed by President Museveni or whether Uganda should retain a multi-party pluralist electoral system.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s13\">The Applicant opposed the adoption of the Movement System and campaigned both generally and through the Church against that system.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s14\">As a result, the Applicant contends that he was harassed and beaten by \"military men\" who supported President Museveni and particularly a group described as the Kalangala Action Group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s15\">7 Prior to the presidential elections on 12 March 2001, the Applicant became very politically active and outspoken against President Museveni in support of a presidential candidate, Mr Kizza Besigye.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s16\">Besigye contended that the government had become corrupt and characterised by cronyism.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s17\">Besigye lost the presidential election and fled Uganda.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s18\">The Applicant says he was actively involved in many rallies and campaigns which criticised President Museveni, travelled to numerous villages campaigning for Besigye and criticised President Museveni to the congregation attending the Applicant's Church.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s19\">8 Immediately prior to the election (about five days) military men detained the Applicant at his workplace and questioned him about his opposition and two days before the election Major Kakooza Mutaale came to the Applicant's Earthlife workplace with soldiers, accused the Applicant of campaigning against the Government through the Church, arrested him, tortured and beat him and threatened to kill him unless he stopped criticising President Museveni.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s20\">The Applicant was released about 10 hours later.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s21\">9 The day before the election, military soldiers came to the Applicant's workplace and instructed him to convince children and other young men and women to support President Museveni.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s22\">The Applicant refused.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s23\">During one rally, children and young men and women were taken by military men, beaten and subjected to physical injury.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s24\">10 After the 2001 election and President Museveni's success, Besigye supporters were frequently harassed, detained and often killed.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s25\">On several occasions, the Applicant was threatened.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s26\">On one occasion, the Applicant was detained for a day, interrogated about aspects of the activities of a group called the Allied Defence Force (\"ADF\") rebels fighting the Government and questioned about the Applicant's support for same sex relationships through various Church projects.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s27\">The Applicant says he was further detained because of his support for Besigye, intimidated and went into hiding for three weeks.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s28\">11 In early June 2002, a man named Mugerwa Charles came to the Applicant's orphanage in difficult personal circumstances and stayed for approximately two weeks.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s29\">His three children, Ssewankambo, Judith and Oliver Charles were already living at the orphanage due to the circumstances confronting their father.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s30\">Mugerwa Charles then left the orphanage to re-join his wife who had acquired a house.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s31\">Later that month, Mugerwa Charles was arrested by military officials and brutally tortured and killed by the group led by Major Kakooza Mutaale because Mugerwa Charles was perceived to be a strong supporter of Besigye and had attended anti-government rallies with the Applicant.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s32\">Mugerwa Charles may also have been an ADF rebel.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s33\">12 The Applicant conducted the funeral service for Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s34\">After the funeral a group of five men in civilian clothes with guns came to the Applicant's office and said they wanted to take the three children of Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s35\">The Applicant refused to deliver up the children.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s36\">The men said they would give the Applicant time to deliver up the children and would return.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s37\">They said that if the Applicant failed to deliver up the children he would be killed like Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s38\">13 During 2001, another incident occurred which the Applicant recounted to the R R T \"for the sake of completeness\" (Documents Book, p.94, para 25), in these terms:\n",

       "   \"During 2001 I was involved in an outreach ministry in northern Uganda.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s41\">They released us, but they said that if we went back again they would get us.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s196\">As to the three children of Mugerwa Charles, the Applicant said, \"I also wanted Mugerwa's children to be taken to a different country, but it did not happen, consequently their death of which [I] am far beyond sure that they were killed by the same security personnel who were pursuing them and killed their Dad\" .</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s381\">The R R T observed that a 'real chance' is one that is not remote or insubstantial or a far-fetched possibility and a person can hold a well-founded fear of persecution even though the possibility of the persecution occurring is \"well below 50%\".</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s382\">64 The Tribunal further noted that, additionally, the Applicant must be unable or unwilling because of his fear to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality or be unwilling to return to his country of former habitual residence.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s470\">His claim of a well-founded fear of persecution is not based upon his membership of the Christ Alive Church.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s471\">The claim made in the submission dated 29 January 2004 [18] was based upon actual or imputed political opinion or, alternatively, a perception that the Applicant was a member of a particular group hostile to the government arising out of his association with Mugerwa Charles.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s475\">Further, although the independent country information describes the scope of the difficulties faced by charity organisations and church groups in Uganda, the information does not go to the issues put before the R R T as the basis for this Applicant's claim of a well held fear of persecution which relies upon a particular perception on the part of the government arising out of the contentious telephone discussion based upon the contentious capture allegation.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s476\">89 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself by treating the information and evidence of George Ddungu with caution and that it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to question George Ddungu's credibility.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s477\">The R R T, in fact, relied upon information put to it by George Ddungu as the basis for testing some of the claims of the Applicant and although the R R T member felt George Ddungu was, in some senses quite naturally, supporting and extending himself in support for the Applicant, the Tribunal simply adopted a cautious approach based upon an apparent inconsistency in George Ddungu's statement concerning his move from Kampala to Masaka.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s478\">90 The Applicant further contends that the R R T misdirected itself as to aspects of the original application by describing aspects of the oral evidence as raising new claims when those claims had been raised in the original application for a protection visa.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s503\">The second aspect involves a recognition that information of that kind is likely to create a risk of prejudice, perhaps subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision, an opportunity to deal with the information.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s504\">95 A question then is whether the information noted at points 7 to 11 [31] of the Tribunal member's conversation with George Ddungu constituted adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s171\">The antiquity of the importance of the relationship between the legal adviser and client in the administration of justice and the preservation of rights and interests according to law was recognised in Shakespeare's dialogue between the conspirators, Cade and Dick in Henry VI, Part 2 when Dick in response to Cade's description of the tyrannical and discretionary character of life and rights in England under Cade's proposed rule, responded, \"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers' .</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s185\">In Propend Finance , Dawson J made the observation at page 515 that to say a document is privileged is merely a \"shorthand way\" of saying that the \"communication\" constituted by the document is privileged which was an expression of opinion consistent with the view His Honour had expressed in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 when his Honour said the privilege attaches only to communications \"made for the purpose of giving or receiving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation\" .</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s187\">43 His Honour, in those observations, is not suggesting that a document which is brought into existence for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings is susceptible to disclosure because the privilege, properly understood, is a function of communications between the lawyer and the client.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s188\">As Gummow J observed in Propend Finance at page 517, the privilege derived from communications with one's legal adviser for the relevant dominant purpose \"extends to the various components of a communication\" and to the extent that a document thus brought into existence is the expression of that communication it becomes the evidence of the communication as McHugh J observed in Esso Australia at page 80 [81].</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s191\">It is why a document which merely evidences a transaction --- a contract, for example --- which is not a communication seeking or giving legal advice or for use in the conduct of litigation (in the sense that it pre-exists in any actual or anticipated litigation) does not attract legal professional privilege, even if it is subsequently given to the legal adviser for the purpose of seeking advice or for use in litigation.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s194\">In those proceedings, J-Corp Pty Ltd sought injunctive relief and damages against the Australian Builders Labourers Federated Union of Workers (Western Australian Branch) (BLF) in respect of alleged contraventions of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s195\">Other respondent unions were joined in those proceedings.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s196\">The matter of relevance for present purposes is that the BLF made arrangements for video tape recordings to be made of events which took place at the applicant's Rivervale building site when the BLF and other respondents established a picket line which was said to have the effect of obstructing or hindering the supply of goods and services to the applicant.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s197\">The BLF contended that the video tapes were made in anticipation of and for the purposes of legal proceedings and were thus the subject of legal professional privilege affording an immunity against disclosure of the video tapes.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s198\">46 In considering the merits of those contentions and the jurisprudential foundation for the subsistence of legal professional privilege, His Honour at page 457 made these observations:\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s207\">Its attraction is a function of whether, so far as the surveillance videos are concerned, they are the emanation of communications made for the dominant purpose of giving or retaining legal advice or the provision of legal services including representation in legal proceedings.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s213\">Ipp J with whom Pidgeon and Wallwork JJ agreed observed that in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674, Jacobs J had said at page 690, \"Communications with one's legal adviser are privileged from disclosure and ... that privilege extends not only to communications actually made but to material prepared for the purpose of communication thereof to the legal adviser\" .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s214\">Thus, material furnished to the solicitor such as a witness statement to assist in contemplated litigation is privileged and on the same basis, the provision of the video film by the photographer to the respondent's solicitor must, consistent with principle, be regarded as a communication.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s215\">In any event, in reliance upon a considerable body of authority, Ipp J concluded that legal professional privilege in relation to communications involving representation in actual or threatened legal proceedings does not depend upon information being \"communicated\".</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s216\">50 The point of departure with the reasoning of His Honour in J-Corp by the Court of Appeal involved the notion that describing the video images as \"real evidence\" or direct evidence of matters in issue did not assist in determining whether legal professional privilege subsisted in respect of the communication of the video.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s217\">The ordinary rules of privilege must apply and in the face of those rules, properly applied according to the proven facts as a matter of common law immunity, there was no \"discretionary power\" to compel the respondent to disclose the video film and compel waiver of the privilege.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s218\">51 There seems to be no real point of distinction between the principles which should apply to the surveillance videos and witness statements brought into existence for the purposes of litigation of the issues in controversy between parties.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s219\">The privilege once established may involve a number of further considerations including whether the client has waived the privilege directly through intentional disclosure, whether the client has waived the privilege by implication and whether the circumstances are such that the necessary element of confidentiality in communication, such as in the case of J-Corp , is lacking.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s220\">It may be that His Honour in J-Corp although he was not directly dealing with the question of implied waiver, had in mind some of the notions which influenced that consideration.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s221\">For example, in Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at pages 487 and 488, Mason and Brennan JJ discussed the notion that circumstances might arise where by reason of some conduct on the part of the privilege holder, it becomes unfair to maintain or extend the privilege.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s222\">Their Honours observed that the holder of such a privilege should not be able to \"abuse it by using it to create an inaccurate perception of the proposed communication\" .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s223\">Similarly, His Honour Deane J observed at page 493 that a person may use privileged material in such a way that it would be unfair for him to assert the immunity.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s224\">52 In the circumstances of the present case, the notion that the video material related to a claim for compensation made by Ms Foster and contained personal information about her provides no basis for rejecting what would otherwise be a proper attraction of legal professional privilege on the facts.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s225\">Accordingly, the Tribunal in finding that the surveillance videos are not exempt documents for the purpose of section 42 of the FOI Act applied an incorrect test to the operation and application of section 42.</sentence>,\n",

       "   (b) for the reasons identified at [22] to [39], the Tribunal applied considerations (in determining whether the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons attracted legal professional privilege), inconsistent with the correct legal test of whether the documents, although reflecting routine or purely procedural matter or information on the public record, are components of a confidential communication between Comcare and its independent lawyers for the dominant purpose asserted in the affidavit of Ms King reflected at [14] and [25];\n",
       "   (c) having regard to the considerations applied by the Tribunal reflected in the Reasons, it was not open to the Tribunal to conclude that legal professional privilege did not apply to the documents identified in paragraph 25 of the Reasons and paragraphs 38 and 39 of the Reasons.</sentence>,\n",

       "   • The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43]\n",
       "   • The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37]\n",
       "   • That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43]\n",
       "   • The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71]\n",
       "   • \"ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s4\">\" [52] \n",
       "  \n",
       "  3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s5\">Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s6\">The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s7\">4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s8\">I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s9\">Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s10\">They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s11\">5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s12\">Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s13\">The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s14\">6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s15\">To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s16\">7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was \"an ameliorating circumstance\".</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s17\">Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s19\">However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s20\">9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s23\">11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s24\">That is a mitigating factor.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s25\">12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s3\">AusCoast holds a Medium Frequency Narrowband Area Service ('MF NAS') radiocommunications apparatus licence issued under s 100(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'), being licence number 1130030 (the '1620 licence').</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s8\">That legislation does not fall for scrutiny in the present case.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s10\">For convenience, and in line with the applicants' written submissions, those services transmitted in the Brisbane area are hereafter referred to as 'the broadcasting service'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s11\">An independent engineering report prepared for WAL by THL Australia Pty Ltd, said by the applicants to be one of Asia Pacific's leading broadcast engineering groups, was to the effect that the 1620 licence provides a signal of 'superior listening quality' to 1,150,065 persons in the Brisbane area, and of so-called 'acceptable listening quality' to a further 882,596 persons in the Brisbane area.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s12\">3 The statutory scheme for licensing the use of spectrum under the Act has been administered by the respondent Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the Authority' or 'ACMA'), and its precursor the Australian Communications Authority, since 1 July 1997.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s13\">Prior to that time, the administration of licensing was undertaken by the Spectrum Management Agency.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s14\">Nothing turns however on those changes in identity of the administering authority.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s15\">The statutory scheme contains provisions, in addition to the issue of apparatus licences, in relation to the duration of apparatus licences (s 103), the general conditions of apparatus licences (s 107), additional conditions of apparatus licences (s 108), changes to conditions of apparatus licences (s 111), the making of guidelines that the Authority is to apply in exercising its powers under sections 107, 108 and 111 (s 112), the suspension or cancellation of apparatus licences (ss 126 and 128 ), the renewal of apparatus licences (s 130) , and the transfer of apparatus licences (ss 131AA and 131AB).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s16\">4 One of the conditions of the 1620 licence, apparently imposed from the time of its first issue, is that the location of the transmitter be 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, being a suburb of Brisbane; that site was referred to in the course of the proceedings as the 'condition site'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s17\">That condition was imposed pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s18\">Other conditions relate to various technical aspects of the radiocommunications transmission authorised by the licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s19\">In spite of that condition, transmission of the broadcasting service has never occurred in any physically operative sense from that site at Manly, that is, from the condition site, at least for the reason that the condition site is located within an established residential area.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s20\">The broadcasting service is presently transmitted from a different location in the Brisbane area, being 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, which is 5.7 kilometres distant from the condition site.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s21\">That site at Tingalpa is sometimes referred to in the parties' submissions as the 'current site', in contrast to the 'condition site' at Manly.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s22\">The effect of the purported decision of the respondent Authority, the subject of the present review application, which was made on 30 June 2005 and affirmed on 18 August 2005, is that AusCoast is not officially authorised to transmit the broadcasting service, or any other radiocommunications service, from the current site, without breaching the locational condition of the 1620 licence referrable to Manly.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s23\">That prohibition, if enforced, would apparently mean that the broadcasting service of the Broadcaster must cease to be transmitted in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s24\">So much would occasion substantial loss and damage, both directly and indirectly, as the applicants understandably emphasised.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s25\">5 As I have already indicated, there is not, nor has there ever been, any radiocommunications transmitter located at the condition site at Manly, that site being located within a residential area of Brisbane and itself comprising residential premises.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s26\">When application was originally made by AusCoast for the 1620 licence, it appears that the condition site at Manly was used by AusCoast as the nominal location site for the 1620 licence because of an inability of AusCoast to identify a suitable location elsewhere for transmission of its broadcasting service to Brisbane, pending proper planning for transmission of radio communications under that licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s27\">The adoption of that course of purported expediency was said by Mr Thompson, the chief executive officer of WAL, to accord with the then practice of administrative convenience in operation at that time in respect of applications for and adoption of transmitter licences.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s28\">As I have foreshadowed, that practice was said to allow an applicant for a MF NAS apparatus licence to identify a convenient address for the transmission site referrable to the applicant's licence, pending completion of comprehensive planning for transmission of radiocommunications under the licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s29\">In fact an application appears to have been made by AusCoast for the change of the transmission site from Manly to another site in the Brisbane locality as far back as 12 November 1996, it being doubtless considered that it would be highly unlikely that the necessary town planning approval could ever be obtained to operate the 1620 licence from within the Manly residential area, owing to the environmental implications that might have ensued to an area of land so zoned.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s30\">A precedent for that practice was identified by the applicants as the MF NAS apparatus licence for Hobart, which was listed nominally by reference to the site of the Hobart Fire Station, even though such location could not constitute a radiocommunications site in any operational physical sense for radio interference reasons.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s31\">6 On 29 August 2003, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the 'Minister') issued Australian Communication Authority Direction (MF NAS Transmitter Licences) Direction No.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s32\">1 of 2003, the practical effect of which was contended by the applicants to be that the holders of MF NAS apparatus licences, such as AusCoast, would not be permitted to transmit a commercial radio broadcasting service under a licence of that designation, unless the service was provided by 29 August 2004 (ie within one year later).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s33\">7 AusCoast commenced transmission of the subject broadcasting service on 5 November 2003 from the current site at 320 Fleming Street, Tingalpa, in alleged satisfaction of the Minister's direction.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s34\">It appears that the transmission of the subject broadcasting service of AusCoast has thereafter continued unabated from the Tingalpa site, and there further appears to have been no complaint communicated to any of the parties to the proceedings, including the Authority, as to AusCoast's transmission of its broadcasting service from the Tingalpa site having caused any interference to any other radiocommunication transmission.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s35\">8 It was the applicants' further case that the current site is an established radiocommunications transmission site, and that its utilisation by AusCoast for that purpose has complied with all relevant town planning, local government and environmental laws, whereas the condition site remains as I have already indicated within a residential area, in relation to which it is highly unlikely any corresponding requisite approvals could ever be obtained in relation thereto; for one matter, there is a block of residential units standing in the immediate vicinity of the Manly transmission site.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s36\">It was therefore that on 6 August 2004, AusCoast applied to the then relevant authority to change the site condition of the 1620 licence from its nominal location in Manly to its operative broadcasting site at Tingalpa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s37\">In the course of the communications which ensued, the Authority alleged that the broadcasting service being provided, in effect under the auspices of the 1620 licence, was being operated in breach of licence conditions, by virtue of transmission occurring from a site otherwise than that stated in the condition to the licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s38\">9 On receipt of that application of 6 August 2004, the Authority responded by fax of 16 August 2004 to the effect that any such variation of the site condition in respect of the 1620 licence was not acceptable, for the reason that it '... would put the station closer to an adjacent [channel] service on 1611kHz at Tingalpa and less than 30km from an adjacent channel service on 1629kHz at Mango Hill ... [and the transmission site] would be closer to a co-channel service at Toowoomba.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s39\">' Of course there existed a degree of artificiality in relation to the expression '... place the transmitter closer...', the placement of the transmitter apparatus being already physically located at Tingalpa, and having never been physically located at Manly.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s40\">10 I should perhaps incorporate reference to further terminologies, practices and policies appearing in the evidence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s41\">A 'co-channel service' is another service broadcasting at the same frequency whereas an 'adjacent channel service' would be one broadcasting at either of the two frequencies each side of the subject apparatus licence, namely 1611 kHz and 1629 kHz in the present circumstances.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s42\">The use of the expression 'closer' by the Authority's officer in the fax of 16 August 2005 is a reference to the application of the so-called '30/160 rule' which rule is enumerated in two policy documents of the Authority.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s43\">The first document is a 'Business Operating Procedure' entitled 'Licensing Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS BOP') and the second document is a 'policy information paper' entitled 'Apparatus Licensing --- Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS PIP').</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s44\">In effect, those policies stipulate a minimum separation distance between MF NAS transmitters on co-channel frequencies of 160 kilometres and for adjacent channels of 30 kilometres.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s45\">Since in the past the enforcement of those minimum separation distances has not always been strict on the part of the Authority (or its predecessors), it has also formulated the 'make it better rule', whereby suggested variations in site location that do not satisfy the '30/160 rule', but which are an improvement on the status quo in terms of the distances between transmission services, may be approved.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s46\">11 Subsequently by letter dated 5 October 2004 a further Authority communication informed WAL inter alia that its application dated 6 August 2004 to relocate the 1620 licence had 'not been finalised' because '... the site co-ordinates that you provided do not meet, or improve, co-channel separation distances'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s47\">Interestingly in the light of the Authority's present submissions, the author of the letter then went on to request 'within one month of today, additional site co-ordinates information and/or details of how [WAL] propose to regularise the operation of [the 1620 licence]', and said that 'this correspondence is to be taken as a request for additional information for the purposes of s 286 of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s48\">' That requested information was apparently provided to the Authority by WAL in a letter dated 27 October 2004.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s49\">By letter of 15 November 2004, the Authority acknowledged WAL's ongoing efforts to resolve its site difficulties, but indicated nevertheless that the broadcasting service was operating 'in breach of licence conditions'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s50\">No express mention was apparently made in that correspondence of 15 November 2004 to WAL's 'application...to relocate [the 1620 licence]', as that application was described in the Authority's earlier letter of 5 October 2004.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s51\">12 Two file notes authored by respective officers of the Authority evidence telephone discussions apparently undertaken by those same officers of the Authority with Mr Thompson of WAL in late 2004.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s52\">In both of those file notes, the Authority's officers claim to have impressed upon Mr Thompson that the Authority 'had already considered the matter [of the variation of the site condition on the 1620 licence]' and had 'arrived at its current position'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s53\">On the second occasion Mr Thompson was apparently invited to make another request in writing, which he duly did by letter dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s54\">That letter sought both the relocation of the 1620 licence to the Tingalpa site but also the revocation of MF NAS apparatus licence number 1402943 ('the 1611 licence'), which had as its site condition a location also in Tingalpa some 7.5 kilometres away from AusCoast's current transmission site.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s55\">13 At this point of the narrative of material circumstances, I would revert back in time to 27 February 1996, being some five months after the issue originally of the 1620 licence to AusCoast.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s56\">At that time in 1996, so the applicants pointed out, the 1611 licence was registered in the name of Queensland Hospital Radio Association.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s57\">The site of the 1611 licence shown in records maintained by the Authority is presently recorded as Bracken Ridge Reservoir.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s58\">Until January 2005, the 1611 licence, that being of course to be distinguished from the applicants' 1620 licence, had a different site location, recorded as being in Tingalpa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s59\">However by about the commencement of 2005, a change to the present 1611 licence site at Bracken Ridge Reservoir was approved by the Authority.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s60\">The Bracken Ridge Reservoir site is 21063 kilometres distant from the condition site at Manly, and 18.291 kilometres distant from the current site at Tingalpa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s61\">Yet the 1611 licence is inoperative and has never operated, so the applicants maintained.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s62\">Those circumstances were raised by the applicants by way of apparent exemplification of at least the alleged elasticity of administration and operation of the Act relevantly to the nomination of site locations of licensees for convenience until an appropriate transmitter site can be found.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s63\">The fact that the 1611 licence had issued some five months after the 1620 licence was said to be explanatory of the request made by WAL to the Authority for the revocation of the 1611 licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s64\">That request, and the events occasioning it, are not of course directly relevant to the present proceedings, but provides potentially relevant background to the principal case of the applicants to be presented, in the event that the applicants are successful in the present interlocutory dispute.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s65\">14 Further discussions and communications have ensued between WAL and the Authority concerning the possibility of AusCoast continuing to transmit from Tingalpa, in circumstances which nevertheless were described on behalf of the Authority as already involving breach of licence conditions, though pending resolution of what an officer of the Authority described as AusCoast's attempts to acquire another licence located at Tingalpa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s66\">By letter dated 23 December 2004, the Authority purported to 'reiterate its advice to [WAL] of 26 August 2004 that [the Tingalpa site] is unsuitable because it does not meet co-channel or adjacent channel re-use distances for a number of services...'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s67\">Next followed a description of the respective services which were said by the Authority to render the request for variation of the site location to involve breach of the Authority's policy on technical requirements.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s68\">There followed on 14 February 2005 a written request from WAL's solicitors to the Authority to make a decision under s 111 of the Act concerning a condition of the 1620 licence, being that the site of that licence be changed from Manly to Tingalpa.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s69\">Critical to the present proceedings is the Authority's correspondence of 30 June 2005, which, after describing the relevant policies and expressing the effect of the proposed relocation on separation distances between the transmission under the 1620 licence and those nearby, was relevantly in the following terms:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   '...the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary the licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]... \n",
       "   \n",
       "   [S]ection 111 confers a power on the [Authority] to unilaterally impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s70\">In this way, the only \"decision\" contemplated by the section is one that will some way change the licence conditions.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s71\">If there is no change to the licence conditions, then for section 111 purposes, no decision has been made.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s72\">It follows from this that it is only where the [Authority] decides to impose, revoke or vary conditions that a review can be sought under the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s73\">\n",
       "   \n",
       "   In this case the [Authority] has not made a decision to change the licence conditions so a reviewable decision has not been made.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s74\">' \n",
       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  The first issue arising in the present interlocutory dispute is whether that communication was a decision ... made... under an enactment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s75\">It is that issue which is addressed by these reasons for judgment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s76\">\n",
       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  15 WAL subsequently requested reconsideration of the Authority's refusal to vary the licence site condition, doing so purportedly pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s77\">WAL also sought from the Authority a statement of its reasons for decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s78\">Both of those requests were refused by the Authority in correspondence of 18 August 2005.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s81\">There is therefore no decision under the Act for [the Authority] to reconsider under section 285 of the Act.</sentence>,\n",

       "  \n",
       "  In respect of WAL's request for a statement of reasons, the Authority said:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   'the decision not to vary the licence condition of [the 1620 licence] is not a decision made under the [Act].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s83\">The [ADJR Act] applies to decisions made under an enactment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s84\">As there has not been any such decision, this request for a statement of reasons is refused.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s85\">' \n",
       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  16 It is further in issue in the present interlocutory proceedings whether the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision pursuant to s 285 of the Act, and to provide a statement of reasons for its decision of 30 June 2005, amounted to decision[s] ... made ... under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s86\">The applicants' reasons for the intervention of curial relief and the nature of the relief sought \n",
       "   \n",
       "  17 It is largely in the context I have already described that what the applicants contend to have been the primary decision of the Authority made adversely to the applicants on 30 June 2005, being a decision followed by the Authority's subsequent refusal to reconsider that earlier decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, or to provide reasons for it, have become the subject of an application for review under both the ADJR Act, and contemporaneously also under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ').</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s87\">The applicants' apprehension is that the practical effect of the decisions of the Authority under review is that their present broadcasting service under the auspices of the 1620 licence must cease to be provided to the Brisbane area, there being apparently no other means by which the applicants could cause their subject broadcasting service to be transmitted to the numbers of persons in that area presently reached.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s88\">The implications of any such outcome are apparently considered to be as damaging as they are far reaching to the applicants.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s89\">18 The applicants' case was that the maintenance of the status quo in relation to the 1620 licence, is vital to WAL's business involving the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, and further that the metropolitan area of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland, is a vital part of WAL's radio network.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s90\">The provision of the subject broadcasting service under the 1620 licence is a key source of the advertising revenue of WAL.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s91\">That is because when allocating advertising to radio networks, advertising agencies place significant weight on the ability of a network to reach audiences in the three major Eastern seaboard capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s92\">Accordingly if WAL is unable to continue to provide a radio network which covers each of those cities, it will be seriously disadvantaged financially when competing in the national radio market, being a market presently embracing at least those three capital cities.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s93\">It was asserted that WAL's reputation as a reliable provider of national commercial radio would therefore also be greatly damaged, with a consequentially adverse impact on all remaining markets in which it presently operates, and therefore on its revenues, share price and returns to shareholders.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s94\">19 The Authority's decision primarily the subject of the present application for review, as I have foreshadowed, was communicated to the applicants by letter dated 30 June 2005, being a decision by the Authority not to vary a condition of the 1620 licence by providing that instead of the site of transmission remaining nominally at 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, the current site of actual transmission at 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa be authorised.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s95\">That nominated site relocation was not entertained because it was said not to meet the Authority's policy relating to separation distances between transmitters.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s96\">That refusal of site relocation decision, according to the applicants, was made pursuant to s 111 of the Act; however the Authority did not so characterise the same, and hence the Authority did not issue a s 287 notice.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s97\">20 Included within the challenge of that decision of 30 June 2005, and hence the subject further of the present administrative review proceedings, are also what the applicants term the Authority's subsequent decisions, each made on 18 August 2005, being not to reconsider its first decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, and also to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for that first decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s98\">The Authority adopted the position that no decision the subject of challenge had been made by it under an enactment, notwithstanding, as the applicants would insist, that a decision of the Authority exercising the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would constitute such a decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s99\">21 The basis provided by the applicants in their amended application for being 'aggrieved' by the three respective decisions referred to above, within the meaning of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, were outlined as follows: \n",

       "   \n",
       "  (b) the first decision was made in accordance with that policy, being a published policy of the Authority, and was based primarily on the reduction in distance between another radiocommunications transmission site at Mango Hill (apparently conducted by Proma Radio) and the Tingalpa site from 30.7 kilometres to 29.6 kilometres; so much was said by the applicants to involve 'an overly rigid application of the policy, which is a policy and not a statutory rule';\n",

       "   The Authority's objections to competency and the applicants' contentions in support of competency \n",
       "   \n",
       "  25 On 31 August 2005, the Authority filed an amended notice of objection to competency which asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to try the application for review brought under the ADJR Act and under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , on the grounds that the decision purportedly the subject of the proceedings is not a decision made under an enactment nor a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s106\">The amended notice of objection to competency went on to state '[i]n the alternative if the court determines that it has jurisdiction there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant[s]'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s107\">The Authority described this as its 'related alternative motion'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s108\">26 As I have foreshadowed, in support of its objection to competency, in relation to the operation of the ADJR Act in the present circumstances outlined by the applicants, the Authority characterised its decision of 30 June 2005 adversely to the applicants, not as a decision to refuse to change the subject site condition for the 1620 licence of the applicants, but rather as a prior decision to decline to consider whether or not the site condition may be varied at all.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s109\">It was largely upon that footing that the Authority contended that the initial or prior decision of 30 June 2005 was not a decision made under an enactment, even though a decision involving the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would seemingly constitute such a decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s110\">The applicants rejoined to the effect that even if that purported distinction was to be taken at face value, the very notion that any such so-called initial or prior decision did not constitute a decision made under the Act immediately encounters forensic and conceptual difficulties.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s111\">The Authority also submitted that the lawfulness of such initial or prior decision was not a ' matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament ...' (see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act ), since it was made under a non-legislative policy, being the subject of the NAS PIP and NAS BOP policy documents referred to above.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s112\">27 The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s113\">It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s114\">Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s115\">Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s116\">Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a \"decision\" are not to be regarded as constituting \"decisions\" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of \"conduct\" as well as of a \"decision\".</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s117\">'\n",
       "   \n",
       "  28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable \"decision\" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s118\">29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s119\">It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s120\">Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s122\">The provision in issue was item 3(e) of Schedule 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth), that item being one of a number of conditions to be satisfied for exemption of the drug from the operation of Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth), which condition read as follows:\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s124\">The Secretary had then notified the appellant Association and advised that on the evidence available, 'nothing would warrant my acting to stop the trials'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s125\">At 62, Lockhart J observed in relation to that notification as follows:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   \n",
       "   'If the Secretary has reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that to continue the trials would be contrary to the public interest and that a direction should be given to stop them, and thereupon gave that direction, surely that must be a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s126\">The sponsor [of the trial] would clearly be a person aggrieved and would in my view be entitled to such a review of the decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  Beaumont J, who reached the same decision as Lockhart J, pointed out at 80 that '... the definition of \"decision\" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed ...'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s129\">Although he reached a different outcome to the majority, Gummow J's observations at 88 are I think also apposite for consideration in the present circumstances:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   \n",
       "   'It was submitted for the Secretary that s 5(1) of the ADJR Act would be attracted only if conferral of the power to give the direction carried with it a duty upon the Secretary.</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",
       "   The submission, in essence, would limit the operation of s 5 of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a public duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus ...</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s132\">In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons:\n",
       "   \n",
       "   \n",
       "   (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa;\n",
       "   \n",
       "   (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; \n",

       "   \n",
       "   (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s135\">Nevertheless it sought to distinguish Right to Life on the basis that in the circumstances of that case, as opposed to the present case, the decision-maker had purported to consider 'the full gamut...of all the relevant issues'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s136\">The Authority's contention was that its officer in this instance had in effect 'terminated the request [made by WAL for a variation in the site condition of the 1620 licence] at the first hurdle', without considering all of the issues that the Authority would normally take into account in assessing a variation.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s137\">I am not persuaded that such contention of the Authority is sound, and that there is in any event any viable difference between the circumstances relevantly in Right to Life and those here prevailing.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s138\">In both instances the decision-maker received a request for a decision to be made to a certain effect, and in both instances there was no provision made under the relevant legislation for such requests to be made by formal application.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s139\">Moreover in both cases, detailed reasons for that request were given by the entity in favour of the decision it sought to be made.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s140\">Most importantly for the outcome of this objection to competency, it was put by the applicants that the refusal of the Authority to make a decision in the terms requested by WAL had the practical effect of constituting an ultimate or operative decision, and hence one which bore the character of finality.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s141\">The applicants' contentions in relation to what it termed the Authority's second decision made on 18 August 2005 \n",
       "   \n",
       "  33 It becomes necessary to consider next the implications of the Authority's so-called 'second decision', being that said by the applicants to have been made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its first decision of 30 June 2005, to the effect that it would not exercise its discretionary statutory power to alter the condition on the 1620 licence so as to change the site of the licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s142\">The Authority's objection to the Court's competency to review the second decision rested however on its objection to competency of review of the first decision, and was therefore said by the applicants to encounter the same or similar difficulties which I have already described in relation to the first decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s143\">The applicants contended that '[t]he plain words of para 285(g) [of the Act] also tell against the [Authority]'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s144\">34 The opening words to s 285, which I have of course already extracted, but nevertheless merit further emphasis, are that ' [a]n application may be made to [the Authority] for reconsideration of any of the following decisions ', the notion of reconsideration being of wide import.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s145\">Moreover the ensuing language of sub-paragraph (g) includes the word concerning , which was also said by the applicants to be of wide import, such that there could be no contextual reason to construe s 285(g) narrowly.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s146\">Hence the applicants contended on that basis that the Authority's decision not to vary the site condition at the centre of the disputation was clearly a decision concerning the conditions of the 1620 licence, that licence being of course an apparatus licence .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s147\">35 It was submitted by the applicants moreover that the wording of s 285(g) of the Act should be compared with other sub-paragraphs of s 285.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s148\">I was referred again to s 285(f) which explicitly refers to the inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107(1)(g) ...' .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s149\">So much was said by the applicants 'clearly' to exclude review of a negative decision, that is to say, a decision not to includ[e] the operation of any conditions in an apparatus licence under s 107(1)(g), which statutory expression is used in marked contrast to what appears in s 285(g), which was described by the applicants as covering 'both positive and negative decisions' by reason of its use in particular of the broad notion of concerning .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s150\">36 It was further submitted by the applicants that if s 285(g) of the Act was intended to be limited to decisions to give a notice under s 111, the Legislature would have used an expression such as that used in s 285(qa), namely decisions giving a notice .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s151\">The point was said moreover to be made even more starkly when other sections of the Act are considered, such as s 118, which by para (a) of subs (1) thereof refers to 'a notice under section 111 relating to changes in licence conditions ...'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s152\">The applicants submitted that it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have used that expression in s 285(g) of the Act, had so much been the legislative intention, and further that the difference in expression provided an indication that para 285(g) has a wider operation than the phrase used in s 118(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s153\">There is considerable force in those submissions of the applicants upon the statutory texts.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s154\">Outline of the Authority's submissions in support of its objection to competency \n",
       "   \n",
       "  37 The Authority's principal contention was that the Act did not impose any duty upon it to consider or act upon requests made by licensees or others to vary the conditions of apparatus licences.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s155\">Instead s 111 of the Act reposed in the Authority a discretionary power to unilaterally vary or revoke conditions of apparatus licences, and s 111 did not provide for a means whereby a licensee could move the Authority to exercise its power under that provision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s156\">The Act was said by the Authority to draw 'a clear distinction' between 'powers in respect of which an application may be made and is necessary and those where no provision is made for an application from an interested person'.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s176\">42 It was the Authority's further contention that its officers paid due regard to policy formulated by the Authority concerning the location of MF NAS transmitters, and took the view, as they were said by the Authority to be entitled to do, that the proposed relocation advanced by the applicants did not meet the policy requirements apparent in the so-called '30/160 rule', or the 'make it a better rule' apparent in the NAS PIP policy, and that as a consequence, it was decided by the Authority that the applicants' proposal should not be further entertained.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s177\">The circumstances of the present case were said by the Authority in that context to be 'broadly analogous' to those considered in a joint judgment of a Full Federal Court (comprising Black CJ, Kiefel and Emmett JJ) in Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, which was concerned with the operation of ss 48A and 48B of the Migration Act .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s178\">The Authority relied upon Bedlington for the proposition that it is open to a decision-maker, who is under no duty to consider exercising a discretionary power, to draft a policy which identifies the types of cases in which the exercise of that discretion might be exercised.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s179\">43 Again I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities involving the application and operation of the Migration Act , which in the case of Bedlington explicitly stipulated that ' the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the [power] ... in any ... circumstances '.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s180\">The Full Court emphasised at 78 of its reasons for judgment that the particular language of subsection 48B(6) was the sole basis for their decision that the Minister was under no duty in any circumstances to exercise the relevant power under s 48B(1).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s181\">The critical issue arising was whether the Departmental Secretary was under a duty to bring the application made for the exercise of the power under s 48B(1) to the Minister's attention in order that the Minister could personally determine whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s182\">Their Honours held that the use of policy guidelines by the Secretary as the basis for refusing to bring the application to the Minister's attention, where such guidelines were specifically intended to identify those cases in which the Minister might consider the exercise of his or her power was valid.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s183\">I have considerable difficulty in discerning the availability of assistance from that further authority, given that it relevantly involved a power that the provision required be exercised personally by the Minister, and concerned only the proposition that the Minister had no statutory obligation to make a decision, and again did not occur in an ADJR Act context.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s184\">Moreover there is no express provision in the Act (ie the legislation the subject of the present proceedings) to the effect that the Authority need not make any relevant decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s185\">All that discourse put forward by the Authority here in relation to migration cases, in any event, ultimately still begs the question as to whether a decision not to make a decision in a particular context nevertheless constitutes a decision ... made... under an enactment within s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s186\">Taken to their logical conclusion, the Authority's submissions appear moreover to run contrary to the warning issued by Gummow J in Right to Life , which I have extracted above, to the effect that limiting the scope of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus would be contrary to the scheme of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s187\">In that latter regard, I would refer again to the text of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act earlier extracted.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s188\">44 In further support of the contention that a decision by an officer to the effect that a request does not fall within an established policy as to which decisions will or will not be entertained, is not a decision...made...under an enactment , the Authority referred me to two additional decisions of this Court.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s189\">The first was Brownsville Nominees Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 169, where Northrop J held that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment under s 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was not subject to review under s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s190\">Section 7(1) of the ADJR Act provides for the making of applications for review of the failure of a decision-maker to make a decision where, inter alia , that decision-maker has a duty to make a decision to which [the ADJR Act] applies .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s191\">Northrop J held at 173 of his reasons for judgment that s 170 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner to make an amended assessment of income tax upon the request of a taxpayer, and thus the application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to issue the amended assessment was not competent.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s192\">I would observe that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment was expressed to the taxpayer in that case in the following terms (at 171):\n",
       "   \n",
       "   '...In the circumstances your request to have the subject assessments amended should remain in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal...'.</sentence>,\n",

       "   \n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s195\">The Authority contended nevertheless that there was no practical difference between that situation and the present, the Authority simply deciding here not to consider the request for a variation at all.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s208\">The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s209\">His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s210\">Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s211\">49 The applicants submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the particular statutory framework addressed in Carter featured a 'staged process of decision-making' whereby before making the ultimate decision of imposing a temporary declaration of preservation , the Minister may make a decision to proceed with such a determination on his or her own motion, such a decision being clearly 'a step along the way'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s212\">By contrast the present legislation (ie the Radiocommunications Act ) features no such stepped or staged decision-making, the power to make the ultimate or operative decision being conferred in its terms by s 111 and relevantly, s 111(1)(c).</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s215\">The issue there arising was whether the decision of a university to exclude a candidate for a doctorate of philosophy on account of academic misconduct was made under an enactment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s216\">In a majority finding to the contrary of that candidate's complaint, the following appears at [89] in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ to the negative of that proposition (their Honours' emphasis appears in non-italics):\n",
       "   \n",
       "   'The determination of whether a decision is \"made... under an enactment\" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s217\">A decision will only be \"made... under an enactment\" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s218\">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s219\">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s220\">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s221\">' \n",
       "   \n",
       "  \n",
       "  Purportedly in the light of that dicta , the Authority contended that its '... decision not to entertain [WAL's] request, however it be characterised, did not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights', but '... left them precisely as they were before the applicants requested the [Authority] to exercise its non-compellable discretionary power'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s222\">Even if that analysis of the Authority be correct in terms of the present circumstances of either one or both of the applicants, notwithstanding implications flowing historically from their enjoyment of transmission from the Tingalpa site, it is an analysis which in any event appears to fall short of the foregoing dicta in Griffith University that '... it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s223\">I would add that counsel for the Authority conceded during the hearing that Griffith University would be of no assistance to him if I were to find that the Authority had in fact exercised its power under s 111 , as opposed to merely declining to do so.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s224\">At least the Authority's communications with the applicants in 2004 point to the former of those propositions as being the case, as do the Authority's file notes of the same year, as is I think sufficiently apparent from what I have earlier extracted therefrom.</sentence>,\n",

       "  51 The submissions of the respondent Authority sought to conclude that '[f]or all of these reasons, the decision of the [Authority's] officers was not a decision under an enactment', and was '... not, therefore, a decision to which the [ADJR Act] applies ... [and] [s]imilarly, the lawfulness of the decision is not a matter arising under a law of the Parliament if it were made under a non-legislative policy'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s226\">The Authority did not elaborate on that latter submission.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s227\">However it is clear that it was predicated on the Authority's construction of its decision that was contended by the applicants to be 'highly technical' and 'prefer[ring] form over substance, contrary to the remedial character of the ADJR Act'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s228\">In essence, as I have foreshadowed already, the respondent Authority contended that the 'decision' was nothing more than the refusal of its own officers to consider whether to exercise the Authority's power under s 111 of the Act, that determination having been made by the relevant officers by reference to the policies of the Authority encapsulated in NAS PIP and NAS BOP.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s229\">52 The Authority accepted that '... this Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to determine whether the [Authority] was under a duty to consider the applicants' request to vary [AusCoast's] licence condition', but asserted that '[n]onetheless, if this Court accepts that the [Authority] was not under such a duty (and remains free from such a duty), the Court would be unable to make an order in the nature of mandamus'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s230\">Absent such an order, so the Authority further submitted, there was no proper basis for any of the relief sought by the applicants', thereby citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 411 at [44]-[48] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and at [98]-[100] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ), in each such instance containing observations relating to the operation of s 417(1) of the Migration Act , whereby the Minister is empowered to substitute for the RRT's decision a decision more favourable to an applicant for relief, if ' ... the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so '.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s231\">Once again I have difficulty in identifying any sufficiency of assistance of authority from a context involving quite different legislation; indeed s 417(7) of the Migration Act at least then explicitly stipulated that ' [t]he Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any decision, whether he or she is requested to do so by the applicant or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s232\">' In any event, as the applicants rightly pointed out, whether or not mandamus might be available against the Authority in relation to the operation of s 111 of the Act, relief pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for declaratory relief was sought by the applicants' amended application which Jacobson J accepted for filing in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s233\">I have of course earlier referred to the applicants' case for relief being framed on that basis by way of additional or alternative relief to that afforded by the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s234\">53 As to what the Authority referred to as its 'related alternative motion', the Authority contended that since AusCoast is currently broadcasting from premises which are not the premises specified on the conditions of its licence, such conduct was unlawful and improper.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s235\">Accordingly, in case the Court was otherwise minded to entertain a grant of relief following a substantive hearing, it was submitted that relief should be refused as a matter of discretion; since the applicants here seek to protect and validate unlawful and improper conduct, and thereby attract the operation of the maxim of equity 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands', discussed in R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines  Remedies , (4 th ed) at [3-110].</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s236\">The relief presently sought by the applicants is however in the nature of administrative and not equitable relief, the applicants having not purportedly founded any case on equitable estoppel.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s237\">In any event I am of course presently concerned with the Authority's notice of objection to competency.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s238\">The relevance of any such matters so raised by the Authority is limited to the Court's determination of final relief, should the Authority's objection to competency fail wholly or in part.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s239\">54 I should add for completeness that in a short supplementary submission, the Authority repeated the essence of its earlier submissions, and submitted further in the alternative as follows ( inter alia ):\n",

       "   'If the court accepts that there is no duty [for the Authority to consider a request made for a variation of an apparatus licence under s 111] but considers that, nonetheless, the Authority made a decision under s 111, the matter would need to go to a substantive hearing.</sentence>,\n",

       "  57 I am further of the opinion, to the extent that it may therefore matter, that in so far as the Authority has contended that the subject decisions of the Authority did not arise under any laws made by the Parliament pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , that further contention must also fail.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s246\">58 It will have been appreciated from observations that I have made in the course of my outline of these reasons for judgment that I would reject the contention of the Authority that its decision-making of 30 June 2005 merely constituted a withholding from consideration of a request of either or both of the applicants to change the site condition of the 1620 licence, whether pursuant to an exercise of a discretionary function or power generally or at large on the Authority's part, or otherwise, and in particular whether by way of exercise of a discretionary power conferred under s 111 of the Act, or otherwise.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s247\">The applicants, or at least WAL on behalf of both of them, in substance and in reality, applied unambiguously to the Authority on 6 August 2004 to change the site condition for the subject apparatus licence being a change which the Authority was empowered to implement pursuant to s 111 of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s248\">A statutory decision-maker does not avoid the operation of the review provisions of the ADJR Act by purporting to create, whether explicitly or implicitly, a standpoint or position involving a decliner of entry upon statutory decision-making, or for that matter of consideration of decision-making unless the statutory scheme for decision-making so provides (cf Carter ).</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s249\">So much however is in reality the position or standpoint which the Authority has seemingly endeavoured to adopt and maintain.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s250\">59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s251\">That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s252\">It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond .</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s253\">60 Moreover by way of reflection of dicta I have cited from Right to Life , and in particular from that of Lockhart J at 62, I would characterise the Authority's conduct culminating in its faxed response of 30 June 2005 as similarly indicative of a conclusion having been reached by the Authority in or to the effect of the first decision postulated in the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s254\">The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s255\">The Authority's communication of 30 June 2005 constituted or involved moreover the very opposite or antithesis of the decision which the applicants had been seeking from the Authority, commencing from WAL's application of 6 August 2004 made to the Authority, being a decision the implications and consequences whereof clearly and in substance affected rights and obligations of the applicants concerning the 1620 licence.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s256\">61 It follows in my opinion that the Authority's objection to competency must fail, at least for the reason that such objection is founded on the erroneous proposition that no decision has been relevantly made under an enactment, pursuant to s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s257\">Whilst that conclusion renders unnecessary any conclusion to be reached as to whether a matter relevantly arose under any law made by the Parliament for the purpose of the operation of s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , I am unable to identify any viable basis in favour of a negative response to that latter proposition of the applicants as well.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s258\">It is moreover not accurate for the Authority to contend that its refusal was a decision made pursuant to a policy as opposed to an enactment, any resemblance here to the factual situation prevailing in Bedlington being merely chimerical, for the reasons that I have indicated above.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s259\">62 It follows from my foregoing conclusions that the Authority's refusal to vary the 1620 licence site condition involves a matter arising under a law made by Parliament of the Commonwealth, the legislative authority to make that decision being conferred by s 111 of the Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s260\">Accordingly I would further find that the purported ground of objection pleaded by the Authority in the alternative, namely that '... there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant', must also fail, owing to the availability at least of declaratory relief to the applicants for the reasons I have earlier explained.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s261\">63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s262\">64 It follows moreover, in the light of all of my foregoing findings, that the further applications to review the Authority's decision of 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its prior principal decision of 30 June 2005, and also the Authority's yet further decision made at the same time to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons in respect of the first decision, must also proceed to a final hearing, the first decision not being one excluded from the operation of s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s263\">65 I should add for completeness that the further concluding contention raised by the Authority in any event to the effect that since AusCoast presently broadcasts from premises at Tingalpa which are not the premises specified in the conditions of the 1620 licence, being conduct asserted by the Authority to be 'unlawful and improper', the Court should as a matter of discretion refuse that relief.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s264\">That subject must be a question for another day, and is irrelevant to the issue of competency per se for the reasons I have already indicated.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s265\">Doubtless on that further occasion, the applicants would seek to pursue in more detail the circumstances and implications of the conduct of the Authority relating to the variation of the site condition on the 1611 licence to the Bracken Ridge Reservoir transmission site, being a conceivable issue apparently to be raised by the applicants from which I would necessarily withhold from further comment at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s266\">Whether that subject is in any event a matter for legitimate consideration in the context of the administrative relief sought by the applicants would be a matter for submission at that further hearing.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s267\">66 The Authority having failed on what has been analogous to a demurrer to the applicants' cause of action, I see no good reason in principle why the applicants should not have the benefit of an award of costs in their favour of and incidental to the present application.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s268\">67 The proceedings will be stood over to a date to be fixed by agreement by the parties, or by the Court in the event that no agreement is reached, for the purpose or making such declarations and orders as may be appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s18\">8 By letter dated 16 February 1996 the Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection for the reason:\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s21\">9 By letter dated 31 October 2003 solicitors acting for the taxpayer filed a statement of facts, issues and contentions on behalf of the taxpayer, however, the matter of additional tax was not raised as an issue and it certainly formed no part of the taxpayer's contentions.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s60\">15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s61\">In support of that focus I was referred to cases which, correctly in my view, hold that the words 'relates to' are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters --- with the connection or association signified by the words being either direct or indirect, substantial or real.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s62\">However, in the present case, there is absolutely no connection or association between the objection decision and the remission of additional tax payable under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s64\">In short, the objection decision in the present case is not an ineligible income tax remission decision under s 14ZS of the Administration Act and, insofar as the Commissioner's appeal is grounded on this issue, it must fail.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s71\">If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s72\">There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision.</sentence>,\n",

       "  <sentence id=\"s75\">The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s76\">21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>,\n",
       "  <sentence id=\"s77\">Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 --- 40.</sentence>,\n",
